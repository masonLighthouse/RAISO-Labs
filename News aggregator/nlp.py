This is a small sample of the toll from ransomware attacks, in which hackers break into computer networks and freeze the digital information until the targeted organization or city pays for its release.
Victims have two bad choices: Give in to extortion and hope the criminals didnâ€™t do too much damage, or refuse and risk the hackers releasing or deleting essential information.
I spoke to Charles Carmakal, an executive with the cybersecurity response company FireEye Mandiant, about the root causes and fixes for ransomware attacks.
What are the root causes of ransomware?"""
